# Canvas Assignment Texter

This set of python files helps me everyday by texting me my upcoming assignments. 
I have it set up on a raspberry pi that will run these files through crontab.
I also have it set up to send me my grades every week.


You can download these files at your pleasure, but use your own config.py file, so that you can enter your own canvas api token and your own phone number, email, and SMTP passwords.
